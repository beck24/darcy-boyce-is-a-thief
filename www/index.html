                    <h3>Darcy the Contractor</h3>
                    <p>
                        In December 2020 we contacted a number of contractors to get quotes to renovate our bathroom.
                        One of the contactors that came to give a quote was Darcy Boyce, who at the time advertised
                        himself as the owner of "Love Your Home Again Renovations".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His price seemed good, we checked that he had a legitimate business license with the city of Nanaimo.
                        There were a number of reviews on his business Facebook page, as well as on external review sites such
                        as TrustedPros. Everything seemed to be in order.
