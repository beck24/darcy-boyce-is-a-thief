                    <h3>Love Your Home Again Renovations</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        In December 2020 we contacted a number of Nanaimo contractors to get quotes to renovate our bathroom.
                        One of the contactors that came to give a quote was Darcy Boyce, who at the time advertised
                        himself as the owner of "Love Your Home Again Renovations".
                        <br><br>
                        His price seemed good, we checked that he had a legitimate business license with the city of Nanaimo.
                        There were a number of reviews on his business Facebook page, as well as on external review sites such
                        as TrustedPros. Everything seemed to be in order, so we hired him for the job.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Darcy Boyce takes our money</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        We wanted a specifc custom tub, shopped around, and he said he would order it from the supplier.
                        He had us transfer him $1602.11 for the cost of the tub.
                        <br><br>
                        In January he came to the house to take drywall samples to test for asbestos.  The test came back
                        positive, and we arranged for an abatement company to remove the drywall.  Darcy told us he could start
                        as soon as it was removed, we scheduled the removal for March 1st.  About a week before then he texted
                        and said he was running behind on another job and asked us to bump the abatement by a week because he didn't
                        want to leave us without a bathroom for an extra week (lol).
                        <br><br>
                        As agreed, the asbestos company showed up on March 7th, they did a fantastic job leaving us with a gutted bathroom
                        down to the studs.  When they were finished we let Darcy know they were done, and he said he would start on
                        the following Monday. He requested a materials deposit of $5000, a deposit which was agreed upon when we hired him.
                        This was expected as I myself am a contractor (programmer) and require deposits before starting work, and my wife works in the construction industry and this is common.
                        We sent him $5000.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Darcy Ghosts</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        He didn't show up for work when he said he would.  Later in the day we got a text saying he was sorry, and that he
                        would be there tomorrow.  Tomorrow was the same thing.  He was still busy with his "other project", he'd be there next week.
                        We waited patiently.  Next week, no Darcy, no contact.<br><br>
                        He wasn't responding to texts, emails, or phone calls.  All we would get is a random text maybe once per week further delaying things, we were getting worried.
                        After 3 more weeks we asked him for a firm start date.
                        Finally he texted, apologizing, saying that he was having trouble at home and his wife had left him, but he'd be there
                        on Monday to get started.  Monday came and went, as did the rest of the week.<br><br>
                        At this point we're done with him.  He's not reliable, even if he shows up we can't trust him, but he has our money.
                        We continue to try to make contact with him, to no avail, meanwhile, we're attempting to find someone else who can build
                        us a bathroom.
                        Eventually he texted and acknowledged that he couldn't do the job, and said he would refund our deposit.<br><br>
                        He hasn't.  Since then he has not been in contact, has not responded to text/email/phone, and has not attempted to refund our money.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Darcy has done this before (allegedly)</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        Since we gave up hope of him being reliable enough to actually start any work, we started reaching out
                        to other contractors to find someone who can build us a bathroom.  We explained what happened and our situation.
                        Many of the contractors wanted to know who it was who screwed us, but we didn't want to name names at that point
                        on the off chance that he would at least come through and give us our money back.
                        Some contractors asked if they could throw some names out, usually people they refer people to just so they know
                        they're not making referrals to a scammer.  One particular person however guessed Darcy's name immediately, saying
                        he had heard this story before from him.  He said that Darcy is a drug addict, and when he hits the drugs hard this
                        is what he does.  This is of course second-hand information, I have no way to verify it, but it certainly jives with
                        our experience.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Darcy Boyce is actively evading us</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        Despite not communicating with us since he said he would return the deposit, he is certainly around
                        somewhere.  He has taken the steps of deleting his company Facebook page, as well as attempting
                        to hide his company on the TrustedPros website by changing the name to Sawzall Construction
                        and adding in a fake owner name.  He is trying to stop us from giving him a bad review that
                        could keep him from potentially scamming others.
                    </div>

                    <h3>What now?</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        Well, we managed to track down the tub that he (surprisingly) ordered.  There were only 2 suppliers
                        that it could have been ordered from.  The bad news is that since it was ordered in his name, they
                        couldn't just give us the tub.  We've had to buy the tub again directly from the supplier.
                        They said they'll refund Darcy if he asks, and then he can refund us.  That has yet to happen.
                        At least we don't have to wait another 8 weeks for a new tub to come in though.
                        However with the surprise cost of the asbestos removal, plus the money he stole, and having to
                        re-buy the tub we're going insanely over budget here.  Then there's inconvenience of a family
                        of 4 not having a main bathroom for 2 months and counting.<br><br>
                        We're going to sue him for what he owes, plus damages.  On to the slow lumbering legal process...<br><br>
                        In the meantime if you know where he is please let me know - 250-667-0871.  I would love to give him an in-person visit.
