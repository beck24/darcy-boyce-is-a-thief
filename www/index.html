                    <h3>Love Your Home Again Renovations</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        In December 2020 we contacted a number of Nanaimo contractors to get quotes to renovate our bathroom.
                        One of the contactors that came to give a quote was Darcy Boyce, who at the time advertised
                        himself as the owner of "Love Your Home Again Renovations".
                        <br><br>
                        His price seemed good, we checked that he had a legitimate business license with the city of Nanaimo.
                        There were a number of reviews on his business Facebook page, as well as on external review sites such
                        as TrustedPros. Everything seemed to be in order, so we hired him for the job.
                    </div>

                    <div class="mt-3">

                      Note that as of July 24th 2021 his business license no longer shows up in the search
                    </div>

                    <h3>Darcy Boyce takes our money</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        We wanted a specifc custom tub, shopped around, and he said he would order it from the supplier.
                        He had us transfer him $1602.11 for the cost of the tub.
                        <br><br>
                        In January he came to the house to take drywall samples to test for asbestos.  The test came back
                        positive, and we arranged for an abatement company to remove the drywall.  Darcy told us he could start
                        as soon as it was removed, we scheduled the removal for March 1st.  About a week before then he texted
                        and said he was running behind on another job and asked us to bump the abatement by a week because he didn't
                        want to leave us without a bathroom for an extra week (lol).
                        <br><br>
                        As agreed, the asbestos company showed up on March 7th, they did a fantastic job leaving us with a gutted bathroom
                        down to the studs.  When they were finished we let Darcy know they were done, and he said he would start on
                        the following Monday. He requested a materials deposit of $5000, a deposit which was agreed upon when we hired him.
                        This was expected as I myself am a contractor (programmer) and require deposits before starting work, and my wife works in the construction industry and this is common.
                        We sent him $5000.

                    <h3>Darcy Ghosts</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        He didn't show up for work when he said he would.  Later in the day we got a text saying he was sorry, and that he
                        would be there tomorrow.  Tomorrow was the same thing.  He was still busy with his "other project", he'd be there next week.
                        We waited patiently.  Next week, no Darcy, no contact.<br><br>
                        He wasn't responding to texts, emails, or phone calls.  All we would get is a random text maybe once per week further delaying things, we were getting worried.
                        After 3 more weeks we asked him for a firm start date.
                        Finally he texted, apologizing, saying that he was having trouble at home and his wife had left him, but he'd be there
                        on Monday to get started.  Monday came and went, as did the rest of the week.<br><br>
                        At this point we're done with him.  He's not reliable, even if he shows up we can't trust him, but he has our money.
                        We continue to try to make contact with him, to no avail, meanwhile, we're attempting to find someone else who can build
                        us a bathroom.
                        Eventually he texted and acknowledged that he couldn't do the job, and said he would refund our deposit.<br><br>
                        He hasn't.  Since then he has not been in contact, has not responded to text/email/phone, and has not attempted to refund our money.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Darcy Boyce is actively evading us</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        Despite not communicating with us since he said he would return the deposit, he is certainly around
                        somewhere.  He has taken the steps of deleting his company Facebook page, as well as attempting
                        to hide his company on the TrustedPros website by changing the name to Sawzall Construction
                        and adding in a fake owner name.  He is trying to stop us from giving him a bad review that
                        could keep him from potentially scamming others.

                    <div class="mt-3">
                      As of July 24, 2021 his company profile on TrustedPros shows as no longer in business.  His business site is still active though.
                    </div>

                    <h3>What now?</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                        Well, we managed to track down the tub that he (surprisingly) ordered.  There were only 2 suppliers
                        that it could have been ordered from.  The bad news is that since it was ordered in his name, they
                        couldn't just give us the tub.  We've had to buy the tub again directly from the supplier.
                        They said they'll refund Darcy if he asks, and then he can refund us.  That has yet to happen.
                        At least we don't have to wait another 8 weeks for a new tub to come in though.
                        However with the surprise cost of the asbestos removal, plus the money he stole, and having to
                        re-buy the tub we're going insanely over budget here.  Then there's inconvenience of a family
                        of 4 not having a main bathroom for 2 months and counting.<br><br>
                        We're going to sue him for what he owes, plus damages.  On to the slow lumbering legal process...<br><br>
                        In the meantime if you know where he is please let me know - 250-667-0871.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Update: July 24, 2021</h3>
                    <div class="text-columns">
                      Since I last updated the site Darcy got in touch with me because he found this site.
                      He made a number of lame excuses, including accusing us of canceling the project on him.
                      He also claimed that he couldn't return the money because it was tied up in all the supplies he had
                      bought to do the job, and in deposits he had paid to sub-contractors.  None of these are valid excuses
                      or even make any sense.  It was the rambling disjointed excuses and "everyone's fault but mine" I've come
                      to expect from small children, and him.<br><br>
                      Anyway, he promised to pay back the deposit, and surprisingly he actually sent $1000 back.  A few weeks later
                      he sent another $1000 back.  This gave us hope.  He then started pretending he had a lawyer and was going to sue
                      us for "hundreds of thousands" in damages we had done to his business by leaving bad reviews about his business
                      and posting this site.  I didn't buy the threat, but since it appeared he was making an effort to pay I figured
                      I would play nice and took down the site.  Meanwhile we kept pursuing the legal course of action.
                      He continued to evade us serving him, so we got a court order allowing us to serve him via text message, which I did on June 24th.<br><br>

                      Since Darcy likes this page so much, I'll also include it here for your convenience. You're welcome:<br><br>

                      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gc1OHRCrwpOcGGIMH99jMUnKY-c4rcXs/view">Notice of Claim.pdf</a><br>
                      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R3-LN27okYI3GpVx-Xf3seztGiFqtQY4/view">replying to a claim.pdf</a><br><br>

                      We were told to wait 3 weeks for him to respond, he never did.  He also went back to ghosting and stopped sending money.
                      We're now filing for a summary judgment for what it's worth.<br><br>
                      So here we are, we've surpassed 100 days since he first said he would pay back the money, which itself was months after he took the money
                      and didn't do the work.<br><br>

                      It seems in the interim his business license has been de-listed from the city site, and his business has been listed as "no longer in business"
                      on TrustedPros.<br><br>
                      
                      I also added a timer to the page, that's fun.
